19
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,200

Iseman Phil

24
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:14,990
yes four boys all swing the other way

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:17,540
this time and all of a sudden it's 9/4 I

26
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:20,030
Ganguly didn't like it he flinched there

27
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:22,189
and look at it swing light after the bat

28
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:24,380
it was on the way across the left-hander

29
00:01:22,189 --> 00:01:28,130
he didn't like the look of it he fended

30
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:31,490
at it and watch it dip now the

31
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:33,380
atmosphere is conducive to plenty

32
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:34,790
in the air and they're off the same

33
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:36,880
maybe this wickets got a little bit in

00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:36,880

00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,320
yeah

36
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:48,510
the hands of Gauri

37
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,680
puts it down

38
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:56,200
first over

39
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,840

40
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:02,010

00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:20,780
Bunnings had a good go at it wouldn't

47
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,710
surprise me to see the Australian to

48
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:27,740
catch these but not the easy ones one

49
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:30,110
foot in it again a tentative push by ten

50
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:33,580
dukkha no conviction about Italy a

51
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:33,580
perfect Barling by Williams

52
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:47,130
squeezy Mart asked the question on fire

53
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:49,970
[Applause]

54
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:52,940
once again the footwork

55
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:55,130
not convincing yet Gillespie has been

56
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:56,870
swinging it to the left doesn't swing

57
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:59,210
this time Tendulkar caught in front of

58
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:03,670
the stumps just a bit high the umpire

59
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:03,670
says and very very correctly

60
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:10,560
something bigs going to happen here

61
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:12,390
Kimberly is like a Cat on a Hot Tin Roof

62
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,040
but he's looking at every gap that's out

63
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:16,200
there he's looking in the air looking

64
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:18,359
to go over the top hasn't been able to

65
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,549
do it yet something's gonna give itself

66
00:03:18,359 --> 00:03:21,930
there gonna be him or Gillespie the

67
00:03:20,549 --> 00:03:24,060
Australians are taunting him on the

68
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:26,629
offside they're asking him to hit over

69
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,629
the top of them

70
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:34,050
he does beautifully well play one dance

71
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:37,920
over the ride full

72
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:39,720
haha what a beauty he's played and

73
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,370
missed this a couple of times and now he

74
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,530
crunches one straight out of the middle

75
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:46,290
don't worry about taunting him he had it

76
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:48,190
on his mind ever since starting this

77
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:51,780
innings that's the shot he wants

78
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:51,780
[Applause]

79
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:56,910
and water from later that that almost

80
00:03:55,140 --> 00:04:00,370
carried is that far from being six

81
00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:04,200
themselves and width on the on side

82
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:04,200
Frieda's arms up and bang

83
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:09,840
he goes again that's gonna fence park

84
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:13,459
aeri what

85
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:16,030
yes it does well played game bill

86
00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:16,030
the history

87
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,870
I think to the biggest square boundaries

88
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:23,560
we'll see in the country as well here in

89
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:26,590
Brisbane he's made it look

90
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:29,470
around Brisbane Creek burn now is very

91
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:31,120
wide and the ropes are in five or ten

92
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:37,540
meters but still as big as we've seen

93
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:39,130
sliced up ish Li and long Ritz when you

94
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:41,230
get a DS body look he's going to the on

95
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:46,139
side that's beautifully striking a

96
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:46,139
caravel yards over the right

97
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:51,060
all of a sudden 10 runs of two

98
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,060
deliveries

99
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:56,520
that's absolutely smashed and along the

100
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,520
ground the hallway

101
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,500
Brad Williams might have said something

102
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:03,000
to ganguly last over and Billy didn't

103
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:06,090
really need to respond after hitting

104
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,520
that shot three big shots through the

105
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:10,320
offside in recent times from Ganguly to

106
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:13,590
off Gillespie and now one off Brad

107
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:17,100
Williams and it's a battle that Ganguly

108
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:18,900
has won I think let's react this summer

109
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:20,550
it seems to me the Australians have said

110
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,200
well let's keep the ball wide of off

111
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:23,550
stop - Ganguly and eventually we'll get

112
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,530
him out now

113
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:28,140
Damian Marc dropped him earlier to stop

114
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:29,730
all this afternoon it's good a ball

115
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:36,950
about obviously a quick departure for

116
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:39,730
Ganguly Williams

117
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:39,730
the last site

118
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,910
Ganguly is gone with the short pitch

119
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:45,509
delivery right at him

120
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:46,870
[Applause]

121
00:05:45,509 --> 00:05:49,090
excellent

122
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:51,070
Fred Williams it's a line though I think

123
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:53,220
Australia should be bowling it even

124
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:56,410
captain for a lot longer over leg stuff

125
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:58,630
not outside off stump the Indian captain

126
00:05:56,410 --> 00:06:00,060
who loves playing square the wicket on

127
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:03,370
the offside has nowhere to go

128
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:06,610
Brad Williams has picked him up so

129
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:09,100
there's three big shots he's with the

130
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:12,840
important ball by Brad Williams at 4:18

131
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:12,840
one for 37

132
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:22,979
basket shot not ducking on this occasion

133
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:22,979
[Applause]

134
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:29,120
brings up the 54 India lovely way to

135
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:30,520
bring it up too soon VVS Laxman dak a

136
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:34,280
few of these short balls

137
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:36,080
Jason less people saw that very ill got

138
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:39,639
away in front of squarely almost off the

139
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,639
tower the bat and saw it that well

140
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:45,440
that's a grandchild

141
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,220
slow

142
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:59,889
1:54

143
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:59,889
[Applause]

144
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:08,140
Paul started become thick and fast now

145
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:10,370
Tendulkar has hurt his ankle there

146
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:12,670
implying that shot

147
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:14,169
I think he's asking for some type

148
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:16,029
[Applause]

149
00:07:14,169 --> 00:07:18,039
was only going to need a tape or a

150
00:07:16,029 --> 00:07:20,560
runner with one of the two this is a

151
00:07:18,039 --> 00:07:22,120
beautiful back foot square cut I will

152
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,879
see quite a lot of pain when he has to

153
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:27,419
put his weight on that back right foot

154
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:31,800
it's when the ankle be tested the most

155
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:31,800
and obviously it's warm at the moment

156
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:37,400
she ate

157
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:40,280
take that it's also controlled pushing

158
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:46,310
off flies back foot shot so he may well

159
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:48,170
need a runner as well then there's only

160
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:51,710
one man who can run for him that's the

161
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:55,060
captain because he's out don't send in

162
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:55,060

to get it right

166
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,590

167
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,750
been cleaned around here's that square

168
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:09,090
cuts beautiful shot it just has to put

169
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:12,200
so much weight and really all is right

170
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:12,200
on that right foot

171
00:08:14,389 --> 00:08:18,699
about quite a bit of pain Sachin

172
00:08:16,159 --> 00:08:18,699
Tendulkar

Australia

you think well I don't want to be

177
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,250
running too much I better hit all

178
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:32,670
boundaries

179
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:35,990
[Applause]

180
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:39,260
the way the injured players do eyesight

181
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:42,289
Cricut Terms and you think you've got

00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:48,080
about retiring hurt thinking about

184
00:08:43,849 --> 00:08:49,940
getting a runner out there or suddenly

185
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:53,380

186
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:53,380
as being barges players and shots

187
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:58,570

for the fields when it

207
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:25,350
toy moves that the ball is going so fast

208
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:27,230
he actually took off as Damian Martin

209
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:31,670
there took off in the ball actually went

212
00:10:36,339 --> 00:10:43,870

213
00:10:39,829 --> 00:10:43,870
gobbles down for a single

214
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:49,589
across India and sitting in this ground

215
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:52,580
only supporters be very happy with this

216
00:10:49,589 --> 00:10:52,580
and he's not finished yet

217
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,580
we were the injured veteran

218
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:03,230
hustle and bustle too much that he's

219
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:06,670
made a brilliant 50 from just fifty

220
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:06,670
three balls carrying an injury

221
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:17,430
that's gotta be close a little shake of

222
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:20,100
the head now

223
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:21,180

00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:24,720
well

225
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:26,250
Laxman very close to being at lbw and

226
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,470
then I think a direct hit would have had

227
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:30,450
him out run out he was I think just

228
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:32,080
contemplating what the umpire was about

229
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:35,359

00:11:42,649 --> 00:11:47,300
as close on the replay and then this is

234
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:49,010
what happened no one anywhere near there

235
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:51,139
he realizes he's out of his ground and

236
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:56,449
had that hit the stumps he would have

237
00:11:51,139 --> 00:11:59,529
been out run out so close calls every

238
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:59,529

and a steelhead snow over balancing the

247
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:25,970
end of the shot was not so much

248
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:28,240
premeditated but was in the back of his

249
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:28,240
mind

250
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:34,160

don't see any advantage of being 15 or

349
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:32,299
20 inside the rope as we speak they've

350

Damien Martin was brilliant stroke play

360
00:18:58,039 --> 00:19:03,090

00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:54,140
three figures would have been reached

438
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:57,050
Australian struggled in the field

439
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:59,980
very good batting pitch because driving

440
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:59,980

good chase unfortunately his little

469
00:25:01,859 --> 00:25:07,769
flick took the ball over the rover

470
00:25:05,479 --> 00:25:09,979
excellent timing there from Matthew

471
00:25:07,769 --> 00:25:09,979
Hayden

472
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:22,470
to a Scottish thing

473
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:22,470

era has seen all this before good

475
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:42,890
attempt there by Yuvraj Singh point

by this combination

478
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:58,460
and then they went after him in the TV s

479
00:25:56,130 --> 00:26:02,340
cup when he was coming back from injury

480
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:04,909
he really needs to find a way to curb

481
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:04,909
these two

482
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:18,950

00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:38,430
at a point but it beat the man on the

489
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:38,430
third man boundary in relative comfort

490
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:45,940
this is perfect example of his glorious

491
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:45,940
timing

492
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:58,330
safe

493
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:03,760
it's good sensible batting all the

494
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:06,610
Creole except two must be inside that

495
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:08,650
fielding circle or fielding area that's

[Applause]

498
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:16,110
the Indian bowlers must have known that

499
00:27:14,669 --> 00:27:17,700
this was going to happen a little bit of

500
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:20,450
swing there for pattern which will

501
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:20,450
encourage him

be needing force

562
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:17,690
[Applause]

563
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:23,919

564
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:26,360
[Applause]

565
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:29,210

566
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:31,730
[Applause]

567
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:33,920
maybe a Mexican spike some patching a

568
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:35,440
very disappointing shot from Ricky

569
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:37,330
Ponting

570
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,970
don't quite understand it actually I

571
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:41,649
think all he needed to do was to knock

572
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:43,559
it around for ones and twos he's trying

573
00:30:41,649 --> 00:30:45,159
to hit that over square leg and

574
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:46,750
unfortunately it's gone straight up

575
00:30:45,159 --> 00:30:48,659
Laxman was cool wasn't he have a look at

576
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:51,639
this target as clean as a whistle

577
00:30:48,659 --> 00:30:53,740
he's a great batsman Barry's pretty safe

578
00:30:51,639 --> 00:30:55,240
as well when it comes to the field and I

579
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:59,940
think they've enjoyed that one they

580
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:59,940
enjoy getting rid of Ponting - down 486

581
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:06,240
[Applause]

582
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:08,570

look at this straight down the ground

588
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:29,650
actually advancing down the ground again

589
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:29,650
and smashing him straight

590
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:41,490

00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:48,030
wedding whistling just above the ground

594
00:31:45,299 --> 00:31:49,460
like a rocket was going towards backward

595
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:52,010
point

596
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:54,010
beautifully taken Yuvraj Singh makes a

597
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:56,809
big difference in the covers to the side

598
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:58,790
this is what he said to him good luck

599
00:31:56,809 --> 00:32:02,290

straight to your garage who's sniffle

603
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:11,650

00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,830
slightly in front yes three four ninety

00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:32,690
I just planted beautiful tonight

609
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:33,950
so boundary number 9 for him really has

610
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:35,410
used the fact that the field is up

611
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:39,110
inside the circle

612
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:40,820
Catching cover man in there really as a

613
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:42,920
run saving position more so than a

614
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:46,720
catchable I'm gonna hit the ball that

615
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:46,720
hard it's particularly tough for him

616
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:52,130
[Applause]

617
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:53,810

pained

620
00:32:56,360 --> 00:33:00,710

621
00:32:58,430 --> 00:33:02,840
about survivors a guy with Matthew

00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:04,790
Hayden he's looking to get forward here

623
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:07,010
the ball was duggard in short but he's

624
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:08,690
good enough well he's off the front foot

625
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:12,430
really he's in weather and a half out of

626
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:12,430
his crease playing a poor shot

627
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:17,480
have the time to do that is a great

628
00:33:14,509 --> 00:33:18,799
skill a few Indian feels when thinking

629
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:21,190
that was a chance but that's just hit

630
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:21,190
too well

631
00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:27,620

close the face while he just popped it

640
00:33:56,370 --> 00:34:00,580
back and was nicely taken one hand and

641
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:03,370
it went back quicker than he

642
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:06,220
that's a very very good catch good

643
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:08,980
delivery had disturbed in on them Andrew

644
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:11,560
Symonds just a little bit to encourage

645
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:13,300
him to hit on the onside and enough spin

646
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:16,190
to get the leading edge but the catch

647
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:19,000
was the brilliant part

648
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:19,000

put that bond market Bevin and

710
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:47,610
dangerous man to have

711
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:53,210
fielding side Bevin is so experienced

712
00:38:50,810 --> 00:38:56,420
we've seen him by quite calmly in

713
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:57,080
difficult situations more recently in

714
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:58,860

00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:11,040
big age on that

India's chances have been preached and

726
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:34,610

727
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,950

42 from 45 he's gone

731
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:53,439
so why why with the boundary

732
00:39:56,010 --> 00:40:00,520
not surprising with the shortcut

733
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:04,000
bobby was ready for it

734
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:05,830
it was a good shot but I'm not too sure

735
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,890
it was a good delivery first up time

736
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:10,480
because the bowler has been moving the

737
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:12,930
ball of the scene when he gets it up to

738
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,930
the best man

739
00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:20,079

pressure

747
00:40:42,619 --> 00:40:47,359
there's a big wicked because it means

748
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:49,999
now that Michael Bevins playing with the

749
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:52,249
bowlers rather than a man who was

750
00:40:49,999 --> 00:40:55,089
capable of hitting some boundaries and

751
00:40:52,249 --> 00:40:58,209
doing a fair bit of damage himself in

752
00:40:55,089 --> 00:41:00,929
safe cash they're taken by Gavaskar 7/4

753
00:40:58,209 --> 00:41:00,929

754
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:09,549

758
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:15,960
thirty out of 24

759
00:41:16,869 --> 00:41:22,450
he's kept a very cool head in this

760
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:24,940
situation Balaji really the only thing

761
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:27,009
he's done wrong in this game is to drop

762
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:30,220
a catch on the boundary outside of that

763
00:41:27,009 --> 00:41:35,490
he's had a very very good match

764
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:35,490
soli gone is tight for 266

765
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:44,959

the gap down to 11

768
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:06,520
too short and he gave the Bevin a lot of

769
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:06,520
areas to hit that Paul finally comes up

770
00:42:07,950 --> 00:42:12,670

784
00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:56,400
piece of fielding the throw was right

785
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:58,860
next to the stumps the ballad she was in

786
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:00,960
the right position as he actually took

787
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:03,030
the ball at brought his hand onto the

788
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:07,940
stumps

789
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:07,940

maybe the bar was should have been in

795
00:43:18,990 --> 00:43:22,020
other side of the stump she had to turn

796
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:27,060
back a fraction but right running by

797
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:32,900

00:43:55,700 --> 00:44:00,150
yes he covered a lot of territories come

807
00:43:58,170 --> 00:44:02,100
from the cover position but the

808
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:05,250
important thing is here he wanted the

809
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:06,780
ball he was off immediately not hanging

810
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:10,230

827
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:04,330
they've bowled extremely well most of

828
00:45:00,910 --> 00:45:07,840
their fielding was was good they've

829
00:45:04,330 --> 00:45:10,119
certainly deserved this victory Laxman

830
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:12,609
and Tendulkar setting it up setting a

831
00:45:10,119 --> 00:45:14,140
very good foundation early on and the

832
00:45:12,609 --> 00:45:16,540
young bowlers have been the ones that

833
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:19,299
have been impressive in these final few

834
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:22,359
overs and

835
00:45:19,299 --> 00:45:25,509
Gavaskar making a good day boo got a

836
00:45:22,359 --> 00:45:27,909
wicked brilliant port involved and did

837
00:45:25,509 --> 00:45:31,439
some good work in the outfield so it's

838
00:45:27,909 --> 00:45:33,699
been an impressive victory by India

839
00:45:31,439 --> 00:45:37,340
particularly because the answers have

840
00:45:33,699 --> 00:45:41,260

841
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:41,260
